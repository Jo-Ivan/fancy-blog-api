And I go, 'Okaaay!' And then I go to the bathroom. And then I come out of the bathroom and I go, 'Any updates?' And they go 'Yeah, we actually have four 30 second ads for you. Because we hate you. Now take this playlist we made based on your songs, go fetch!' And I go, 'Okaaay!' and I go over to the Spotify app and go, 'Can I change my album covers please?' and they go 'NO!' And I go, 'Okaaay!' And then I go over to the Spotify help desk, which is an oxymoron, and I go, 'Can I please listen to three songs without being interuptted?' and they go 'No! In fact, we're gonna frame you for murder, and you're gonna go to jail for thirty years!' And I go, 'Why are you doing this to me?!' And they go, 'Because we're Spotify",

I don't want my dragons to turn into effing commodities. I know they're just collectible pixels and you'd think that would be perfect to tokenize, but it kind of strips all the heart and soul out of the whole experience of breeding dragons, writing lore for them, even just hatching a lucky egg... I'm scared that this stuff is going to spread.",

    text: "I hate that I’m always trying to find cool biology themed stuff to wear but all the 'nature inspired' clothing companies just have like two crossed arrows or a minimalistic mountain on a sweatshirt. Effing lame, that’s barely even nature-adjacent. Put the life cycle of a salamander on a jacket, put hyena skeleton patterns on leggings, put a darn field guide of birds of prey on a peacoat and THEN you can have my money. Do NOT give me a shirt with a leaf on it that says 'stay wild' or some BS I would much prefer clothing that broadcasts to everyone around me how many teeth an adult Jaguar has or how some pitcher plants can catch and digest rats.",
